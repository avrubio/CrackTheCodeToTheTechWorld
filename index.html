                  which involves me dedicating an hour a day to coding and writing on
                  LinkedIn what I learned each day. That got me noticed by quite a few

            <p> I created it because lately, I‚Äôve had many
              people reach out to me for advice on resources and what they should do since they
              are starting out. I figured it would be better to have a guide that I could give each
              person full of many resources and tips and tricks to help. It would be great to
              connect with each and every one of you so add me on LinkedIn and provide any
              feedback you‚Äôd like about this guide!</p>
