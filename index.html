    <h1>Unleash Your Tech Potential</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the journey of a lifetime! In this guide, I will show you some
      FREE resources I have found that I think would be helpful for those just
      beginning to explore the tech space. Prepare to discover your passion and
      turn it into a thriving tech career!
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: Research</h2>
    <h3>
      ROADMAPs for UX/UI Designers, Technical writers, software developers,
      DevOps/AWS engineers
    </h3>
    <span> Visit RoadMap.SH</span>
    <a href="    https://roadmap.sh">Roadmap.sh</a>
    <h2>Step 2: Network</h2>
    <h3>
      Speak to like-minded individuals and ask an expert about the role that
      interests you!
    </h3>
    <p>
      So now that you have narrowed down the role you are interested in, I
      suggest you start looking for people to network with on LinkedIn and ask
      if they would have a coffee chat with you to learn more about their role,
      their day-to-day at the company they currently work at, and how they
      landed the role! Many people are willing to chat with others interested in
      switching to the tech field and will provide a lot of valuable advice that
      can help guide you on the next steps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up a calendly to better organize your meetings</li>
      <li>
        Have a list of open-ended questions you think will need to understand
        their role
      </li>
      <li>ask them what job boards they used to find their role</li>
      <li>what local communties they recommended joining</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Learning/Training</h2>

      interest!

        8/10 your local library has free resources for their community, check
        out your local library’s website and go to their resources page and see
        if they give card members access to Gale-Udemy or even LinkedIn
        Learning.

        I like Gale-Udemy because you get access to hundreds of courses for FREE

    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: optimize your resume</h2>
    <p>
      You may be thinking that none of your past roles or your current roles are
      relevant to the new tech role you want but that’s not the case! You have
      MANY transferrable skills that are valuable to you succeeding in your new
      tech role.
    </p>

    <p>
      My favorite tool to use is ChatGPT to help me figure out ways to rewrite
      job duties! You will have to play around with your wording when asking
      ChatGPT to rewrite your transferable skills but my favorite way to start a
      prompt is by telling it to act as an expert in the subject area I am
      trying to fix, for example:
    </p>

    <p>
      My prompt: I want you to act as an expert tech industry resume writer and
      reword this job duty in a way that shows my transferrable skills.
      “Handling and resolving customer complaints regarding product sales to
      customer service problems” ChatGPT response: Certainly! Here's a revised
      version that emphasizes your transferrable tech skills: "Managed and
      resolved customer inquiries spanning product sales and customer service,
      leveraging technical expertise to address issues seamlessly from initial
      contact through resolution. Demonstrated proficiency in troubleshooting
      and effectively communicating solutions, contributing to enhanced customer
      satisfaction and retention."
    </p>

    <p>
      This is of course a little too long of a job duty, you always want to aim
      for one sentence per job duty but it’s a great baseline to nitpick the
      verbiage you’d like to use in your new resume template!
    </p>

    <p>
      Don’t downsize any previous job you’ve had, they are all valuable life
      experiences that form your professional self to this day and have helped
      you reach to the point you are now! REMEMBER THAT!
    </p>

    <h2>Step 5: optimize your Linkedin and get noticed!</h2>
    <p>
      Your LinkedIn is one of the most important things employers see alongside
      your resume, especially in the tech industry. It’s also necessary because
      you will be using LinkedIn to network with people as I mentioned in Step
      2.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Here’s a checklist of things you should be doing to optimize your
      LinkedIn:
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Get a professional headshot and use this on LinkedIn.</li>
      <li>
        Create an authentic banner that includes your name and portfolio, be
        creative with it don’t pick a stock photo on Canva and call it a day.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a capturing headline but avoid using the words aspiring or
        looking for a tech role. Think of your headline as a short sweet
        elevator pitch. What do you bring to the table? I transform ideas into
        code OR I help companies automate their workflow. You could also ask
        ChatGPT for help with this with a similar prompt from the resume
        writing: I want you to act as an expert LinkedIn career coach, and help
        me write a good eye captivating headline, I am just starting out in tech
        and I am learning technologies to be _XYZ_.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write your summary and tell your reader why your switching to teach,
        what motivates you, and what you hope to accomplish if and when you land
        such a position!
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you know what role you’re aiming after, look at groups of people on
        LinkedIn who are working their way towards the same goal. As a Latina, I
        follow groups like Latina in Tech, Somos Tech, Coffee & Code, etc. A lot
        of the groups do meet-ups and you get to meet other like-minded
        individuals that are just starting out just like you or people already
        in the role you want!
      </li>
      <li>
        Document your journey! Write a post a day on LinkedIn and youse hashtags
        so you can get your posts noticed and interact with other people’s
        posts. As a developer I’ve personally done #100daysOfCode, which
        involves me dedicating an hour a day to coding and writing on LinkedIn
        what I learned each day. That got me noticed by quite a few people and
        helped me network with others. Remember when I said companies also look
        at your LinkedIn? Yeah well if you're documenting your journey you're
        showing evidence that you are dedicated to learning and becoming better
        at the role you are going after!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Thank you so much for reading this guide. I created it because lately,
      I’ve had many people reach out to me for advice on resources and what they
      should do since they are starting out. I figured it would be better to
      have a guide that I could give each person full of many resources and tips
      and tricks to help. It would be great to connect with each and every one
      of you so add me on LinkedIn and provide any feedback you’d like about
      this guide!
