      <h2>Step 4: Optimize your resume</h2>
      <p>
        You may be thinking that none of your past roles or your current roles
        are relevant to the new tech role you want but that‚Äôs not the case! You
        have MANY transferrable skills that are valuable to you succeeding in
        your new tech role.
      </p>

      <p>
        My favorite tool to use is ChatGPT to help me figure out ways to rewrite
        job duties! You will have to play around with your wording when asking
        ChatGPT to rewrite your transferable skills but my favorite way to start
        a prompt is by telling it to act as an expert in the subject area I am
        trying to fix, for example:
      </p>

      <p>
        My prompt: I want you to act as an expert tech industry resume writer
        and reword this job duty in a way that shows my transferrable skills.
        ‚ÄúHandling and resolving customer complaints regarding product sales to
        customer service problems‚Äù ChatGPT response: Certainly! Here's a revised
        version that emphasizes your transferrable tech skills: "Managed and
        resolved customer inquiries spanning product sales and customer service,
        leveraging technical expertise to address issues seamlessly from initial
        contact through resolution. Demonstrated proficiency in troubleshooting
        and effectively communicating solutions, contributing to enhanced
        customer satisfaction and retention."
      </p>

      <p>
        This is of course a little too long of a job duty, you always want to
        aim for one sentence per job duty but it‚Äôs a great baseline to nitpick
        the verbiage you‚Äôd like to use in your new resume template!
      </p>

      <p>
        Don‚Äôt downsize any previous job you‚Äôve had, they are all valuable life
        experiences that form your professional self to this day and have helped
        you reach to the point you are now! REMEMBER THAT!

      <h2>Step 5: Optimize your Linkedin and get noticed!</h2>
      <p>
        Your LinkedIn is one of the most important things employers see
        alongside your resume, especially in the tech industry. It‚Äôs also
        necessary because you will be using LinkedIn to network with people as I
        mentioned in Step 2.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Here‚Äôs a checklist of things you should be doing to optimize your
        LinkedIn:
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Get a professional headshot and use this on LinkedIn.</li>
        <li>
          Create an authentic banner that includes your name and portfolio, be
          creative with it don‚Äôt pick a stock photo on Canva and call it a day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a capturing headline but avoid using the words aspiring or
          looking for a tech role. Think of your headline as a short sweet
          elevator pitch. What do you bring to the table? I transform ideas into
          code OR I help companies automate their workflow. You could also ask
          ChatGPT for help with this with a similar prompt from the resume
          writing: I want you to act as an expert LinkedIn career coach, and
          help me write a good eye captivating headline, I am just starting out
          in tech and I am learning technologies to be _XYZ_.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write your summary and tell your reader why your switching to teach,
          what motivates you, and what you hope to accomplish if and when you
          land such a position!
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you know what role you‚Äôre aiming after, look at groups of people
          on LinkedIn who are working their way towards the same goal. As a
          Latina, I follow groups like Latina in Tech, Somos Tech, Coffee &
          Code, etc. A lot of the groups do meet-ups and you get to meet other
          like-minded individuals that are just starting out just like you or
          people already in the role you want!
        </li>
        <li>
          Document your journey! Write a post a day on LinkedIn and youse
          hashtags so you can get your posts noticed and interact with other
          people‚Äôs posts. As a developer I‚Äôve personally done #100daysOfCode,
          which involves me dedicating an hour a day to coding and writing on
          LinkedIn what I learned each day. That got me noticed by quite a few
          people and helped me network with others. Remember when I said
          companies also look at your LinkedIn? Yeah well if you're documenting
          your journey you're showing evidence that you are dedicated to
          learning and becoming better at the role you are going after!

      Thank you so much for reading this guide. I created it because lately,
      I‚Äôve had many people reach out to me for advice on resources and what they
      should do since they are starting out. I figured it would be better to
      have a guide that I could give each person full of many resources and tips
      and tricks to help. It would be great to connect with each and every one
      of you so add me on LinkedIn and provide any feedback you‚Äôd like about
      this guide!
